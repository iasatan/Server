Anyone Who Had A Heart
You're My World (Il Mio Mondo)
You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'
Sing A Rainbow
Don't Answer Me (Ti Vedo Uscire)
A Fool Am I (Dimmelo Parlami)
What Good Am I
Where Is Tomorrow (Non C'e Domani)
Surround Yourself With Sorrow
Conversations
If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind
Your Song
I Don't Know How To Love Him
Baby We Can't Go Wrong
When You Walk In The Room
