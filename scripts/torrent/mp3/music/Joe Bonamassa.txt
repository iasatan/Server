The Valley Runs Low
You Left Me Nothin' But The Bill And The Blues
Distant Lonesome Train
How Deep This River Runs
Livin' Easy
What I've Known For A Very Long Time
This Train

The Valley Runs Low
Dust Bowl
Driving Towards the Daylight
Black Lung Heartache
Blue and Evil
Livin' Easy
Get Back My Tomorrow

How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live?

Woke Up Dreaming
Hummingbird
The Rose
