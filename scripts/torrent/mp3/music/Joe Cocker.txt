Feelin' Alright
High Time We Went
Marjorine
She Came In Through The Bathroom Window
Shelter Me
You Can Leave Your Hat On
Can't Find My Way Home
Darling Be Home Soon
My Father's Son
Fire It Up
Unchain My Heart
Delta Lady
With A Little Help From My Friends
When The Night Comes
Come Together
Summer In The City
Don't You Love Me Anymore
Have A Little Faith In Me
Woman To Woman
Tonight
Night Calls
Hard Knocks
