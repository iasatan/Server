Since You've Been Gone 
Respect 
I Apologize 
Walk On By 
The Shoop Shoop Song 
My Guy 
Whos Zoomin Who 
(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman 
Think 
Until You Come Back To Me (That's What I Am Going To Do) 
A Rose Is Still a Rose 
Shoop Shoop Song, The 
I Say A Little Prayer 
It Won't Be Long 
Try A Little Tenderness
