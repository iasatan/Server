This Train
Mountain Climbing
Blues Of Desperation
The Valley Runs Low
You Left Me Nothin' But The Bill And The Blues
Distant Lonesome Train
How Deep This River Runs
Livin' Easy
What I've Known For A Very Long Time
Drive
Dust Bowl
Driving Towards the Daylight
Black Lung Heartache
Blue and Evil
Get Back My Tomorrow
Mountain Time
How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live?
Song of Yesterday
Woke Up Dreaming
Hummingbird
The Rose
