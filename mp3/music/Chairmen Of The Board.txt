Give Me Just A Little More Time
You've Got Me Dangling On A String
Patches
Since The Days Of Pigtails
Everything's Tuesday
Bless You
Pay To The Piper
Tricked And Trapped (By A Tricky Trapper)
Charimen Of The Board
Hanging On To A Memory
I Can't Find Myself
Try On My Love For Size
Men Are Gettin' Scarce
Working On A Building Of Love
Everybody's Got A Song Yo Sing
Let Me Down Easy
Elmo James
I'm On My Way To A Better Place
Bittersweet
Finder's Keepers
Everybody Party All Night
