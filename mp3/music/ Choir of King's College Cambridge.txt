Once in Royal David's city 
While shepherds watched their flocks 
O little town of Bethlehem 
See amid the winter's snow 
Shepherds in the fields abiding 
Personent hodie 
In the bleak midwinter 
Myn liking 
Gabriel's message 
King Jesus hath a garden 
The shepherd's cradle song 
A virgin most pure 
The infant King 
Three kings 
Blessed be that Maid Mary 
The day thou gavest Lord is ended 
Hark! A thrilling voice is sounding (Vox Clara Ecce Intonat) 
O come all ye faithful
